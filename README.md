# Metaverse Tokenization Template

This repository provides a starting point for tokenizing aspects of a metaverse or game environment on the Ethereum blockchain (or compatible EVM chains). The template includes a Solidity smart contract designed to streamline the creation and management of in-world tokens—be they fungible utility tokens or NFTs representing unique items, virtual land, avatars, or other valuable digital assets.

## Features

- **Modular Smart Contract Design**:  
  A Solidity contract that can be easily extended or integrated into your larger DApp ecosystem.
  
- **Fungible & Non-Fungible Token Support**:  
  The included contract demonstrates how to issue ERC-20 compatible tokens for in-metaverse currencies, and can be extended to handle ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens for assets like items, parcels of land, or other unique objects.
  
- **Upgradeable Structure**:  
  The contract is structured to allow modifications and extensions without starting from scratch, making it easier to iterate as your metaverse evolves.
  
- **Gas Efficiency Considerations**:  
  Basic design patterns and techniques are included or suggested to help keep transaction costs manageable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js & npm/yarn**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and a package manager such as `npm` or `yarn` installed.
- **Hardhat or Truffle**: A development framework for compiling, testing, and deploying the smart contracts. This template assumes you’re using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) but you can adapt it to Truffle or Foundry.
- **Ethereum Client or Test Network**:  
  - For development and testing, use a local test network (e.g., Hardhat Network).
  - For staging and production, connect to testnets like Goerli or Polygon Mumbai, or mainnets like Ethereum or Polygon.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cryptolyfe/Metaverse_Template.git
   cd Metaverse_Template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
   or
   
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Project Structure

```
Metaverse_Template/
├─ contracts/
│  └─ MetaverseTemplate.sol  // Example template contract
├─ scripts/
│  └─ deploy.js              // Example deployment script
├─ test/
│  └─ MetaverseTemplate.test.js // Basic test suite
├─ hardhat.config.js
└─ package.json
```

- **contracts/**: Contains Solidity source files. `MetaverseTemplate.sol` is where your token logic resides.
- **scripts/**: Deployment and interaction scripts. Customize `deploy.js` to fit your requirements.
- **test/**: Unit tests to ensure the contract behaves as expected. Use `npm run test` or `yarn test` after configuration.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the contracts, run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Testing

Run the included tests to verify the contract’s functionality:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

You can write additional tests in `test/` to cover new features or modifications.

### Deployment

Update `scripts/deploy.js` with the desired constructor parameters and run:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
```

Replace `<network_name>` with a local or remote network specified in `hardhat.config.js`.

**Example** (local Hardhat network):

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## Customization

1. **Fungible Token Logic (ERC-20)**:  
   Adjust initial supply, token name, and symbol as needed. Add custom business logic such as transaction fees, staking, or governance hooks.

2. **Non-Fungible or Semi-Fungible Tokens (ERC-721/1155)**:  
   Extend the contract to manage unique assets or collections. This might include minting functions for avatars, land parcels, or special in-game items.

3. **Access Control & Permissions**:  
   Integrate role-based access control (e.g., using `Ownable` or `AccessControl`) to restrict certain actions (like minting or burning) to specific addresses or contracts.

4. **Integration with Other Contracts**:  
   Connect this template with game logic contracts, marketplace contracts, or reward distribution mechanisms to build a complete metaverse ecosystem.

## Roadmap

- **Add More Templates**:  
  Include additional reference contracts for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens.
  
- **Advanced Features**:  
  - Implement upgradeable proxies (e.g., OpenZeppelin Upgradeable Contracts) for seamless feature rollouts.
  - Add oracles and price feeds for dynamic pricing and scarcity mechanics.
  
- **Scaling Solutions**:  
  Integrate layer-2 solutions for faster, cheaper transactions suitable for frequent in-metaverse interactions.
