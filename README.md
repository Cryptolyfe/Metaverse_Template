# Metaverse Template

A starting point for building your own metaverse experiences, this template provides a foundational structure and essential components to kickstart development. Whether you’re creating a social VR world, an interactive AR environment, or a fully immersive 3D space, this template streamlines the initial setup so you can focus on customizing the experience.

## Features

- **Basic Scene Setup**: A pre-configured Unity scene with lighting, skybox, and environment elements.
- **Character Controller**: Simple character movement and camera controls to navigate the environment.
- **UI Elements**: Basic UI templates for menus, HUD elements, or in-world interfaces.
- **Extensible Scripts**: Modular C# scripts that can be easily extended or replaced to fit your project’s needs.
- **Project Structure**: A clear folder hierarchy to keep assets, scripts, and settings organized.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Unity**: This project was built using [Unity 2021.3 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021-lts) (or higher). Make sure you have the appropriate Unity version installed.
- **Version Control (Optional)**: Using Git or another VCS is recommended for team collaboration and version management.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cryptolyfe/Metaverse_Template.git
   ```
   
2. **Open in Unity**:
   - Launch Unity Hub.
   - Click on **"Open"**.
   - Select the cloned `Metaverse_Template` folder.
   - Once opened, Unity will import the assets and you will be ready to explore the project.

- **Assets/**: Contains all game assets including models, textures, materials, scripts, and UI.
- **Scenes/**: Contains the main scene (`SampleScene.unity`), which you can duplicate or rename as needed.
- **Scripts/**: Core scripts for character control, camera movement, and UI interactions.
- **UI/**: Basic UI assets and prefabs for menus and heads-up displays.

## Customization Guide

1. **Adding 3D Models & Assets**:  
   Drop your 3D models, textures, and sounds into the `Assets/` directory. Consider organizing them into subfolders for better maintainability.

2. **Updating the Character Controller**:  
   The default character controller script can be found in `Assets/Scripts/`. Modify it or replace it entirely to support your desired movement mechanics (e.g., VR hand-tracking, flying, or teleportation).

3. **Enhancing the UI**:  
   Adjust the UI prefabs in `Assets/UI/` to change menus, HUDs, or tooltips. Integrate UI frameworks or third-party plugins as needed.

4. **Networking & Multiplayer**:  
   This template does not include networking out-of-the-box. However, you can integrate a networking solution (e.g., Photon, Mirror, or Unity’s Netcode) by adding the necessary packages and hooking into the character and world logic.

## Roadmap

- **Future Integrations**:  
  - Add VR support and input mapping for popular headsets.
  - Integrate basic networking for shared multiplayer experiences.
  - Provide sample inventory, commerce, or social interaction scripts.

- **Enhanced Environments**:  
  - Include more sophisticated lighting setups.
  - Add environmental storytelling elements like interactive objects or NPCs.
